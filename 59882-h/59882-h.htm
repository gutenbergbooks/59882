<h2 class="oneline">Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>Charlemagne, or Charles the Great, might
well have been entitled Charles the Greatest.
He was great in war and great in peace&mdash;a
great conqueror, great law-maker, great scholar,
great organizer, great civilizer. He subdued savage
nations, introduced learning, extended religion, encouraged
the arts and sciences, and established one
of the mightiest empires of the olden times. All
the races of Germany, of Italy, and of France were
welded by him into one great monarchy. He maintained
and extended the influence of Christian culture.
A large part of his life was spent in the field,
and yet he found time for the political establishment
and development of a great empire, for the
reorganization of the Church, for the promotion of
education, for the conservation of classic culture,
and for an astonishing display of many-sided activity.
Gibbon, the historian, says of him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The dignity of his person, the length of his reign, the
prosperity of his arms, the vigor of his government, and
the reverence of distant nations, distinguish him from
the royal crowd: and Europe dates a new era from his
restoration of the Western Empire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>He was a monarch whose life was characterized
by extraordinary activity and energy, by nobility
of purpose and wisdom in administration, and by
a constructive genius and innate capacity for wise
and generous ruling, which have rarely been found
in &ldquo;the royal crowd.&rdquo; As one of the most conspicuous
figures in history, the events of his life as narrated
in this volume deserve careful study at the
hands of youth.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Ingelheim</span></h2>
<p>It was at Ingelheim<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> on the Rhine that Charlemagne
usually established his court during the
middle period of his reign. An obelisk upon
one of the adjacent heights, erected in 1807, bears
the inscription, &ldquo;Charlemagne&rsquo;s highway.&rdquo; The
erection of his palace at this spot shows his keen
appreciation of its natural beauty. The view from
these heights toward the Rhine, Johannisberg,<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> and
the Rheingau,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> taking in a blooming, fruitful valley,
is incomparably fine. In one of the descriptions of
the vicinity, it is related that Charlemagne was the
first Frankish ruler who built in the grand style.
It says:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A great admirer of the monuments of Greek and
Roman architecture, Charlemagne was not satisfied with
the simplicity of his ancestors, and sought to combine
the useful and the beautiful, the comfortable and the
artistic. He built not merely as the owner, but like a
king. He selected one of the most beautiful spots on
the heights of Rheingau for the palace of Ingelheim.
The broad river, enclosing numerous islands in its strong
arms, is visible throughout its entire course from the
bend where it enters Rheingau, below Mainz, to the point
where it plunges into the dark abyss of Bingerloch. The
smiling meadows along its banks at the foot of vine-clad
hillsides spread out like a charming panorama.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The palace itself is described by contemporaries
as a wonder of art, transplanted as if by magic from
the Italian Ravenna to the banks of the Rhine.
Charlemagne secured the hundred marble and granite
columns upon which the structure rests, as well as
the mural decorations of the interior, through the
favor of the Pope. Barbarian opulence in buildings
was usually displayed in the lavish use of gold and
silver, and artistic effect was sought for in brilliant
metallic shimmer. But Charlemagne employed gold
and silver only for the decoration of that beautiful
work of art&mdash;the reproduction of the old palace at
Ravenna upon the Ingelheim heights&mdash;a conspicuous
evidence of that great change in times and customs
by which not only the abode, but eventually
the title and sceptre, of the C&aelig;sars came into the
possession of a German sovereign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Contemporaneous descriptions of the personality
of Charlemagne have also been preserved. According
to the chronicles of Eginhard, he was large and
symmetrical of body and stood about seven feet
high. He had full, bright eyes, a strong nose, beautiful
hair, and a frank, open countenance. Whether
sitting or standing, he inspired reverence by his
dignity. He was often upon horseback in war or
the chase. He loved bathing as passionately as the
chase, and often buffeted the green waves of the
Rhine with his strong arms, but he was fonder of
the warm mineral baths of Aachen<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> (Aix-la-Chapelle)
than of the river water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>According to the Eginhard chronicles also, Charlemagne
usually wore the Frankish costume, which is
thus described in a chronicle at Saint Gall<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Frankish costume consisted of shoes, set off with
gold adornments fastened by scarlet bands about the legs,
and flaxen hose of the same color, figured in a most skilful
manner. Then came the inner coat of bright canvas
material, shoulder belt, and sword. The remaining detail
of the costume was a gray or blue four-cornered mantle,
doubled and so disposed that when worn over the shoulder
it fell to the feet before and behind, but barely covered
the knees on the sides. A staff was carried in the right
hand, made of a sapling with symmetrical knobs, and
with a handle of gold or silver finely wrought. It was at
once beautiful, strong, and cruel. The mantle was made
of a thick woollen stuff called &lsquo;Frisian&rsquo; in the northern
Netherlands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Such was the costume generally worn by the
Emperor. In winter, however, the chronicle says
that he protected his shoulders and breast with an
outer garment of otter and marten skins. He disliked
foreign dress, and wore it only once or twice
in Rome at the request of the Pope. He carried a
sword at his side continuously with a golden hilt
and belt. Now and then he made use of one set
with jewels, but only upon ceremonious occasions,
or when receiving embassies. At the high festivals
he wore a gold-embroidered dress, shoes set with
gems, a mantle fastened with a golden clasp, and a
golden, jewelled crown. From another narrative of
events in the times of Charlemagne, we quote the
following:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Although the Franks were excellent riders and generally
fought on horseback, they did not participate in
tournaments, although the principal feats of the tournament
were conspicuous for the exercises which the young
warriors enjoyed practising. The really grand occasions
of the Franks were their religious and state festivals,
where they displayed their fondness for splendor and
churchly pomp. The brilliancy of the state festivals, to
which Charlemagne summoned representatives from far
and near, was enhanced by the presence of the monarch
seated upon his high and gorgeous throne. A blue mantle
covered his shoulders, and upon his head he wore a refulgent
diadem. His right hand held a golden sceptre.
His spouse wore a crown above her veil, which, like her
dress and those of the court ladies, glittered with pearls,
rubies, diamonds, and other costly gems, procured in trade
or taken as spoils of war. The dukes, counts, and other
nobles surrounding the throne wore girdles adorned with
gold, silver, and jewels from the Orient. Their fur-trimmed
mantles suggested the habits of their fathers
and the experiences of the forests. Palace functionaries
stood back of the Emperor; heralds threw gold pieces to
the crowd; and musicians sang and poets recited hymns
in honor of the Frankish heroes. Festivals of this kind
lasted several days. The guests at a signal from the horn
mounted their horses to hunt boars and buffaloes, which
were abundant in those days&mdash;a pastime which called for
impetuous courage, as it was attended by great danger.
As gentler sport they fished and hunted with falcons and
other birds of prey. Still other sources of pleasure were
ball games and chess contests. In Charlemagne&rsquo;s time
the Franks were passionately devoted to both, but the
Emperor cared little for such sports and rarely played
chess, which seemed to him merely a pleasant way of passing
time, which to him was of the highest importance and
too valuable to be wasted. The meals in the homes of
the wealthy consisted of three courses: the first, a salad of
mallows or hops, which were considered as appetizers and
aids to digestion; the second, plain bread and pork or
venison; and the third, pastries and fruit. Wine was
rarely used, and consequently there were few displays of
bad passions. The common beverages were beer and
mead. Poor families and even those fairly well off ate
turnips, lentils, beans, and other vegetables, and upon
festive occasions a goose and some kind of pastry. However
great the wealth or high the rank, the utmost importance
was attached to the hair and beard, which were
considered indications of strength and courage&mdash;qualities
which commanded respect at that time. The grandees
exchanged a hair as a sign of mutual agreement. A
promise was often sealed by touching the beard. A
debtor who could not pay was considered the slave of
his creditor and tendered him the shears with which to
cut his beard. If a young warrior was taken prisoner
by one of the barbarians and doomed to death, he would
beseech his captor not to soil his hair with blood or allow
a slave to touch it. Agreements were annulled by breaking
a straw. Hospitality was regarded as a sacred rite,
and guests were treated with almost religious reverence.
The household furniture was simple. The walls of the
rooms were covered with painted and gilded leather, and
the floors were covered with straw mats, woven by the
women of the house. Except upon festival days, when
sumptuous display was expected, there was the utmost
simplicity both in the homes of private persons and at
the Court of Charlemagne.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Charlemagne&rsquo;s wife and daughters took an active
part in the household duties. The daughters learned
to spin and weave when they were quite young, and
Charlemagne much preferred the garments which
they made. Angilbert, a scholarly friend of the
Emperor, has left a description of the palace at
Ingelheim as well as of a hunting party in which the
Emperor&rsquo;s spouse, Lindgard, and the sons, Carl and
Pepin, figure. He says:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s charming wife, Lindgard, enters the
courtyard followed by a numerous train. Her cheeks
vie in tint and glitter with the roses, and her hair with
the shimmer of a purple robe. Her brow is bound with a
purple fillet, jewels sparkle on her neck, and a golden
crown glitters on her head. As she enters with her ladies,
courtiers make way to her, right and left. She mounts
her horse, which is brought to her, and beams with royal
dignity upon the crowd of nobles surrounding her two
sons, Carl and Pepin. The one who bears his father&rsquo;s
name resembles him in figure, countenance, and spirit.
He is in full armor&mdash;a valiant warrior, tried and true.
Following the queen and princes, the hunters crowd
through the gates accompanied by a tumult of sound
from hound bells and horns. Next appear the princesses
with their retinue. Rotrud rides at their head, calm of
face and proud in bearing. Her blonde hair is fastened
by a purple band, and a little gold crown gleams upon
her brow. Next, Bertha, the image of her father in face,
voice, and disposition. Her blonde hair is intertwined
with gold cords and wreathed with a diadem. A marten-skin
covers her snowy neck, and the seams of her tightly
fitting cloak are set with glittering jewels. Next rides
Gisela, dazzlingly white and beautiful. Purple threads
are interwoven in the delicate texture of her veil. Silvern
gleam her hands, golden her brows, her eyes shine
like the sun, and she manages her fiery steed with perfect
ease. Ruodhaid on her gracefully ambling palfrey
follows. Hair, neck, and feet glow with jewelled ornaments,
and a silken mantle, fastened at the breast with
gold clasps, covers her shoulders. Then follows Theodora,
she of the rosy face and gold-red hair, wearing a
necklace of emeralds and a gorgeous mantle. Hiltrud,
last of the sisters, appears and, after glancing around
majestically, turns her steed in the direction of the forest
whose dark recesses invite this imposing expedition.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Where was Charlemagne, master of the house and
the Empire, as the hunting party set out?&mdash;gazing
at the animated spectacle from the palace balcony,
or in the stillness of his apartment studying serious
problems upon which depended the weal or woe of
his empire?</p>
<p>The solution of these problems was a weighty
matter. He had inherited not honors alone, but
burdens which needed a giant&rsquo;s strength to carry.
His life was a continuous struggle with forces
which hurled themselves against his empire. To
understand his situation we must consider the circumstances
which confronted him when the crown
of the Franks became his heritage. We must revert
to the past and review the history of the Empire
down to his accession, that we may clearly understand
what this hero and sovereign contended
against and accomplished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Retrospect</span></h2>
<p>The Franks, inhabiting both sides of the Rhine,
held a leading position among the German
tribes about the middle of the fifth century,
three hundred years before the time of Charlemagne.
They invaded Gaul from the north and subdued
that part of it occupied by the Alemanni<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> and Burgundians,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>
and securely established themselves in the
eastern and southeastern parts of the country,
southern Gaul being occupied by the West Goths.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>About this period Clovis<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> made his appearance
among the Franks. He was brave to the extreme
of hardihood and at the same time thoroughly unprincipled.
He ruled over one family<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> of Franks,
relatives of his being chiefs of the others. The
family ancestor of the Franks was Merov&aelig;us, from
whom the Merovingians derived their name.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding their relationship, the Frank
chiefs were in continual strife with each other, but
Clovis at last secured a kind of sovereignty over all
the families and forced his relations to furnish him
with warriors. As soon as this was accomplished, he
set about making his power absolute and suppressing
their mutual quarrels, as he was determined they
should assist him in further invasions of Gaul. The
only remnant of Roman power left in Gaul (that
part of it lying between the Seine and the Loire)
still maintained its political independence. It was
against this region, which was under the rule of the
Roman patrician Syagrius, that Clovis next directed
his operations. He provoked him to war, defeated
him, and forced the West Goth King, Alaric the Second
(who was ultimately slain in battle by Clovis),
with whom Syagrius sought shelter, to give him up.
He then strangled him in prison.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Clovis next made war against the Burgundians,
who, as has been said, occupied the southeastern
part of Gaul and were ruled at that time by two
brothers, Gundobald and Godegisel. Both fell victims
to his cruelty. One of the dead brothers left
a daughter Clotilde, for whose hand Clovis appealed
to her uncle, the Burgundian chief. The uncle did
not dare refuse Clovis&rsquo;s request, and Clotilde, the
Christian, became his wife. She immediately set
about the task of converting him, but did not succeed
at that time. His purpose was to secure her inheritance,
not her religious faith.</p>
<p>Before concluding final arrangements with the
Burgundians another problem presented itself for
settlement. The Alemanni were threatening Siegbert,
one of his relations. This gave him a sufficient
pretext for drawing his sword against them. A
decisive battle was fought at Toul.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> It was a
bloody encounter, and victory at first appeared to
favor the Alemanni. Thereupon, thinking of Clotilde&rsquo;s
appeals to him, he invoked the Christians&rsquo;
God before his whole army and promised to become
a Christian if he won the victory. Thereupon he
massed his forces and hurled them upon the enemy
with such fierceness that the onset was irresistible.
The Alemanni were decimated, and Clovis occupied
the entire region between the Neckar and Lahn
and forced it to supply warriors to make good his
losses. In the same year he and three thousand of
his followers were baptized at Rheims.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The German chiefs who had embraced Christianity
at an earlier period had given their adhesion
to the Arian confession, but Clovis gave his to the
Catholic. There was great rejoicing in Rome, and
the Pope conferred upon him the title of &ldquo;All Christian
King,&rdquo; which title also descended to his Frankish
successors. Later the clergy spread the report
abroad that a miracle took place at the time of
Clovis&rsquo;s baptism. It was said that there was no
consecrated oil at hand. As the bishop stood helpless
at the altar a white dove suddenly flew down
with a flask of oil in its beak, a sign that his name
had been inscribed in heaven and that his conversion
had given delight to God and the angels. To
satisfy the sceptical, the wonderful flask was preserved
in the Cathedral of Rheims, and the precious
contents were not diminished, though it was used
whenever the rite was repeated. In fact the flask
was used at every coronation down to the close of
the last century. The story of its origin spread
and is believed by some even to this day. Neither
baptism, nor anointing, nor papal titles, however,
could change the deceitful, truculent, bloodthirsty
nature of Clovis. He next turned against his wife&rsquo;s
Burgundian relatives, who were subjugated and compelled
to pay tribute to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Clovis was now master of Gaul even to the southern
part of it, which had belonged to the West Goths
who a century earlier, under the leadership of Ataulf,
had taken possession of the country north and south
of the Pyrenees (southern Gaul and northern Spain).
As there was no political pretext for making war
upon the West Goths he found a religious one. The
&ldquo;All Christian&rdquo; King Clovis assembled the bishops
and secular leaders and thus addressed them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall the West Goth heretics occupy that beautiful
country and persecute our Catholic brethren?
Arise in the name of our faith and conquer them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clovis had now openly declared his adherence to
the Catholic faith, and there was fresh rejoicing in
Rome when it was known that he had undertaken a
crusade against the West Goths. He was victorious
in a battle with Alaric the Second, whom he slew
with his own hand, but was prevented by Theodoric
the Great,<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> father-in-law of Alaric, from subjugating
the entire West-Gothic kingdom. He had to be
content with the sovereignty of the region between
the Loire and the Garonne (Provence) as part of
the Frankish Empire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Clovis&rsquo;s career was continually marked by injustice,
cruelty, and bloodshed. One outrage rapidly
followed another. He next sought to add the possessions
of his Frankish relatives to his kingdom.
Siegbert, with whom he had fought against the
Alemanni, was a cripple because of a wound received
in the battle of Toul. Clovis sent word to his son
that his father had lived too long, and that if he
were out of the way they might be friends. The
dissolute son had his father murdered, and sent this
message to Clovis: &ldquo;My father is no longer living.
Send messengers to me, and they shall take whatever
you need from my treasures.&rdquo; Clovis sent his
messengers, but upon another errand. The young
prince led them to the treasure chamber and they
assassinated him there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Clovis next assumed the role of avenger of Frankish
chiefs killed by Siegbert. He summoned the
heads of the Frankish families and brought such
inducements to bear that they voluntarily acknowledged
his authority and accepted his sovereignty.
He secretly inspired an uprising against one relative,
who had proved too obstinate; and when he
was brought before him by his own people in chains,
Clovis exclaimed: &ldquo;What! are you not ashamed to
appear before me in chains and to disgrace our
princely race?&rdquo; With these words he cut off his
head with a battle-axe. He also killed his victim&rsquo;s
brother because he dared to protest. Sooner or
later all his relatives who wavered in allegiance
suffered from his wrath. Then he began to grow
anxious lest some one of the family might have been
spared. He hypocritically lamented that he had
not a relative he could trust. He instituted a search,
but all inquiries were useless. He was in undisputed
possession of a kingdom which extended from the
mouth of the Rhine to Switzerland on the south,
to the Atlantic ocean on the west, and almost to
the Pyrenees on the southwest. He thought himself
secure against all enemies, but in his forty-fourth
year death overtook him.</p>
<p>Four sons inherited his kingdom, but there was
no peace among them or any of their descendants
during the next two centuries. Treachery, assassination,
and poison were the agencies employed by
the male members of the princely house to gain
their end. Petty jealousy, envy, and revenge drove
their wives to crimes of the worst description.
Simplicity of customs disappeared from court life.
Roman civilization accomplished its fatal work. The
once princely Merovingian race was degenerated by
physical and spiritual weakness.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The result of all this was a change in governmental
relations. Before the close of the sixth century the
weak Merovingians relinquished the responsibilities
of rule to the mayor of the palace.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> Among those
who filled the position, Pepin of Landen, the founder
of the Pepin family afterwards known as Carolingians
or Carlovingians, was conspicuous. That the
Frankish kingdom, which included also Burgundy
and Thuringia, escaped dissolution was entirely due
to this powerful Pepin family. Subsequently Pepin
of Heristal, a member of the same family, rose to
the honor of leadership. After many distinguished
achievements, his son Charles, who was called Charles
Martel, or &ldquo;the Hammer,&rdquo; because of his victory
over the Moors in 732, succeeded him. The Frankish
kingdom, as well as the German Christian world,
was saved by him from a great disaster at the hands
of the Moors, who twenty-one years later (711)
overthrew the power of the West Goths in Spain
and established themselves there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Another Pepin, called &ldquo;the Short,&rdquo; by reason of
his low stature, succeeded Charles Martel. The
enemies of the country&mdash;the Saxons particularly&mdash;felt
the weight of his power. An enmity of long
standing existed between the Saxons and the Franks,
and they had often met in fierce encounters. It is
hard to say which side was to blame, but it is certain
that the Saxons, especially after the Franks had
been Christianized, often invaded the country of the
latter, and that the war which Pepin waged against
them was to that extent a just one. He at last subdued
them and forced them to pay tribute. It was
in Pepin&rsquo;s time also that the form of government
was restored to the old royal system; and while he
accomplished this he also insisted that the influence
of the clergy should not be impaired. First of all
he sought to secure the favor of the bishops of the
country, and succeeded so well that two of them
agreed to settle matters with the Pope. Everything
seemed to favor his plans. The Pope was hard
pressed by the brave Lombardian King Haistulf
and in sore need of help. After consultation with the
bishops Pepin compelled Haistulf to give up his
possessions to the Pope, and the Pope recognized
the Franks as defenders of the Church.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Pepin the Short, like his predecessors, Charles
Martel, Pepin of Heristal, and Pepin of Landen,
achieved great results for the Frankish kingdom.
For some years he carried on war with Aquitania
and eventually added that country to his dominions.
When the Saxons hesitated about paying the tribute
which his father had exacted from them, he drew his
sword and compelled them to keep their agreement.
When he realized that his death was fast approaching,
he divided his kingdom between his sons,
Charles<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> and Carloman. Charles, the elder, inherited
Aquitania, Austrasia,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> Thuringia, Bavaria,
Mainz, and Worms; Carloman inherited Burgundy,
Alsace, Provence, and Alemannia. Neustria<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> was
divided equally between them.</p>
<p>Pepin died in 768.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Charlemagne and Desiderius</span></h2>
<p>Charlemagne was born at Aix-la-Chapelle
in 742 and was twenty-six years of age when
he became sovereign. His brother Carloman died
in the third year of his reign, which left
Charlemagne ruler of the whole kingdom. It may
be stated in advance that he enjoyed but one year of
peace during his forty-six years of power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hammer and anvil&rdquo; was the paramount method
of action in the political world of those days. There
was never any possibility of living at peace with
one&rsquo;s neighbor. It was either oppress him or be
oppressed by him. There was no middle course.</p>
<p>Let us now follow the campaign of Charlemagne
against Desiderius, King of the Lombards.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> To
make its significance and progress as clear as possible
we must first of all consider the relations of Charlemagne
and his brother Carloman, who, as already
stated, died in the third year of his reign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>The consent of the grandees of the Frankish kingdom
was necessary to the validation of Pepin&rsquo;s
division of the kingdom between the two sons.
The restriction, however, was made by Pepin that
while Charlemagne and Carloman were invested
with their new dignities, the Frankish kingdom
should remain a united kingdom, its administration
only being divided between them. Pepin&rsquo;s wishes
were respected, and measures were taken to maintain
the unity of the kingdom. But the two brothers
had hardly assumed the task of sovereignty when
an event occurred which put to the test their good
faith and their readiness to carry out the obligations
laid down by Pepin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Wolf, chief of the southwestern Frankish dukedom,
raised the banner of revolt, believing that he
could now accomplish what his predecessor, Waisar,
had striven in vain to do while Pepin was living.
Charlemagne promptly prepared to suppress the uprising,
and called upon his brother Carloman to assist
him. Carloman declined, and Charlemagne was
forced to act alone; but he quickly succeeded in
quelling the revolt. It is not strange that he and
his Franks were angry at the conduct of his brother,
and that there were many, not only in his own, but
in his brother&rsquo;s part of the kingdom, who regretted
that Charlemagne had not been made sole ruler.
Carloman&rsquo;s action was not only regarded as faithless
toward his brother, but even stigmatized as
treachery against the united kingdom, the evil consequences
of which could be averted only by Charlemagne&rsquo;s
strong arm. The latter&rsquo;s leading warriors,
indeed, had been in favor of taking the field against
Wolf without paying any attention to his brother.
It was due to Charlemagne&rsquo;s mother, the royal
widow Bertha,<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> that the world of that day was
spared the tragedy of a fraternal and civil war.</p>
<p>This distinguished lady, who was so greatly beloved
by the people that she was celebrated in later
tradition as &ldquo;The Swan Maiden,&rdquo; was tenderly
loved by Charlemagne. She determined to overcome
his resentment against his brother and reconcile
them. She succeeded in doing this, but had hardly
done so when Carloman died. The grandees and
church dignitaries thereupon assembled and named
Charlemagne ruler of the whole Frankish kingdom.
They recognized the danger confronting a divided
kingdom and hastened to avert it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Gilberga, Carloman&rsquo;s widow, if she had been wise
would have placed herself under the protection of
Charlemagne and her mother-in-law, the widow
Bertha. Instead of this, she was induced by Charlemagne&rsquo;s
enemies to leave the country, with the
intention at a favorable time of asserting the rights
of her two sons. This she soon did at the court of
the Lombardian King, Desiderius, who entertained
strong animosity against the Franks. Pepin had
forced King Haistulf, Desiderius&rsquo;s predecessor, when
he was threatening Rome and had seized Ravenna,
to give up not only the Roman, but other possessions
to the Papacy. This was not forgotten by Desiderius;
and when, after Haistulf&rsquo;s death by a fall
from his horse, he succeeded him, he regarded himself
as heir to the Papal throne and the avenger of
Haistulf; and he lost no opportunity of intermeddling
in Roman affairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>After the death of Paul the First, in Rome, a layman,
named Constantine, came to the Papal chair.
Christoph and Sergius, chiefs of the opposing faction,
thereupon betook themselves to Desiderius
and appealed for his assistance, which he was willing
to give, as he had his own advantage in view. Constantine
was promptly deposed, seized as a prisoner,
and blinded. Desiderius then determined to place
a Lombardian in the Papal chair, and instructed
the two Lombardian priests, Waldibert and Philip,
to organize a party in Rome which should select
Philip as Pope. Too late, Christoph and Sergius
regretted that they had invoked the help of Desiderius.
In the meantime, however, they accomplished
the removal of the two Lombard priests
by an uprising. The new Pope Philip and his assistant
fled to a church. The right of asylum,
however, was not recognized by their enemies.
Philip was consigned to the dungeon of a monastery,
and Waldibert was torn from the image of the
Virgin, to which he was clinging, and blinded.</p>
<p>Christoph and Sergius succeeded in electing a
Roman as Pope, who took the name of Stephen
the Third; but as he did not manage affairs to
please them, they determined to depose him by force.
Realizing the danger which threatened him, Stephen
appealed to Desiderius, who again showed himself
ready for any service which should inure to his own
advantage. The most friendly assurances were extended,
and Stephen, in letters to Charlemagne and
his mother, could hardly find words to sound the
praises of Desiderius, who was doing so much for
Rome. Christoph and Sergius, who had mustered
a considerable force, were attacked by Desiderius and
defeated, and both were made prisoners and blinded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Stephen now was at the mercy of Desiderius, who
used every means in his power to compel him to
surrender voluntarily to him the possessions which
Pepin had restored to the Church. This proved a
fresh source of resentment on Charlemagne&rsquo;s part
against Desiderius. He only waited for Stephen to
appeal to him for help, and held himself in readiness
to lend it; but his plans were frustrated by a new
move which he could not resist. His mother, who
had gone to Italy, interposed and wrote letters to
him which led to anything rather than a warlike
view of the situation. Although she had no doubt
of the lion-hearted nature of her son, or of the valor
of his army, she could not view the dangers arising
from a conflict between the Franks and the Lombards
without the gravest solicitude. She was sufficiently
shrewd and experienced to appreciate the
situation. She reflected that the Bavarian Duke
Thassilo, her dead husband&rsquo;s nephew, without whose
consent Charlemagne could not have attained to
sovereignty, was as inimical to him as Desiderius
was. Thassilo had proved disloyal to Pepin in refusing
him the assistance he was in duty bound to
furnish in the war against Waisar, Wolf&rsquo;s predecessor.
Bertha knew that death alone prevented
her husband from punishing his perfidy. As Thassilo
and Desiderius were now on good terms she
feared that if Charlemagne should attack the one,
the other would come to his help. Besides this, the
Saxons to the north of the Frankish kingdom were
in arms again. She also feared in case of war
that the West-Frankish dukedom would rise again.
Lastly, she knew that Desiderius had promised the
widow and sons of Carloman to provoke an uprising
in their favor in the Frankish kingdom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>To avert these dangers Bertha planned to bring
Desiderius, Thassilo, and Charlemagne into a tri-partite
relationship, and thus establish friendly
conditions. She proposed that Charlemagne and
Thassilo should marry daughters of Desiderius and
that Adalgis, Desiderius&rsquo;s only son, should marry
Gisela, Charlemagne&rsquo;s sister. The plan was accepted
by all concerned except the fair Gisela, who chose to
go to a convent and engage in its pious duties, rather
than wear a crown.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> She is honored in the Catholic
Church to-day under the name of Itisberg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>The daughter of Desiderius selected by Bertha as
the spouse of her son was named Desiderata. She
is described as a princess of beautiful face and stately
mien. Bertha presented her to Charlemagne, who,
in the meantime, had separated from his first wife,
the daughter of a Frankish nobleman. At that time
marital separations and remarriages were not uncommon
among the upper classes, and some of the
very highest class had several wives. Bertha had
managed this business secretly, and the Pope did
not hear of her plans until Desiderata had gone to
the Frankish country. It is not strange that the
news caused him the greatest anxiety, for he clearly
foresaw that if Charlemagne became the son-in-law
of Desiderius, he could no longer look to the Franks
for the protection of the territory which Pepin had
taken from the Lombards and given to the Church.
He wrote an urgent letter to Charlemagne, imploring
him to break off marriage with Desiderata, even
going so far as to declare that the Lombards, notwithstanding
they had been living with the Roman
people, were still little better than carrion, and the
descendants of lepers. He closed with these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have sent you this our appeal, from the grave
of Saint Peter, and with our tears. Should you&mdash;which
we cannot believe&mdash;defy the authority of
Peter, our master, the ban will be imposed upon
you. You will be banished from God&rsquo;s Kingdom
eternally to consort with the devil and the wicked
in the everlasting fires of hell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>When Charlemagne received this letter the wedding
festivities were already over. The warning
had come too late. Whether of itself it would have
thwarted the plans of Bertha is uncertain, but in
any event it strengthened the prejudice of Charlemagne
against Desiderata which he had had from
the first. It was not long before she became so
unbearable to him that he sent her back to her
father. The conciliatory work of his mother, well
intended as it had been, was ruined.</p>
<p>Desiderius, enraged to the extreme both against
Charlemagne and the Pope, held the latter principally
responsible for the affront put upon his daughter,
and resolved to wreak vengeance at once. He
demanded that the Pope should crown the son of
Carloman as King of the Franks, intending after
that to incite an uprising in that country in his
favor. The time seemed auspicious, as Charlemagne
was now at war with the Saxons. While the Pope
was hesitating, and just as Desiderius was about to
use force, Stephen died and was succeeded by
Hadrian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Hadrian could not be induced to crown the young
prince, either by flattery or by threats. Desiderius
thereupon began harrying the Papal territory and
advanced to lay siege to Rome. As he occupied
all land communications, Hadrian sent messengers
to Marseilles and thence to Diedenbofen<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> the seat
of Charlemagne&rsquo;s court at that time. In his letter
Hadrian informed the King of Desiderius&rsquo;s demand
and his threatening movement, and implored him not
to let him fall into Desiderius&rsquo;s hands. Immediately
after the receipt of this letter Charlemagne received
one from Desiderius, in which the latter, to gain time
for carrying out his designs against Rome, assured
him he had given up everything to the Pope which
belonged to him.</p>
<p>Charlemagne, however, was not deceived. The
favor which Desiderius had shown to the son of
Carloman clearly revealed his hostility to himself.
He decided upon war with the Lombards at once,
and the campaign was begun in the autumn of the
year 773.</p>
<p>Charlemagne mustered his forces at Geneva. Their
equipment was essentially different from that formerly
used by the Franks. They were armed with
the longer Roman spear as well as the larger shield,
the latter furnishing better protection for the body
than the round Frankish shield. In place of the old
leathern head-covering they wore the brazen helmet
and visor. The body was also protected by a coat
of mail. Many of the soldiers carried heavy clubs
in place of the long swords. These formidable
weapons were made of knotted oak, cased in iron,
and sometimes made entirely of that metal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Upon the advice of those Franks who were hostile
to Charlemagne and had been entertained at the
court of Desiderius, the Alpine passes leading into
Lombardy were obstructed besides being strongly
guarded. In this way Desiderius felt certain he
could defy Charlemagne. Another event increased
his feeling of security. Charlemagne, in consideration
of the natural resentment of a father whose
daughter had been humiliated, sought once more
to establish friendly relations with him. He appealed
to him to acquiesce in Pepin&rsquo;s assignment of
territory to the Church and to abstain from any
assault upon his sovereignty. Unfortunately for
Desiderius, he looked upon this as a proof that
Charlemagne recognized the impossibility of invading
Italy. Thereupon he contemptuously rejected
the offer and went so far with his insolence that
the latter, realizing now that war was inevitable,
exclaimed: &ldquo;He does not fear the barking of the
German dog so long as it does not come out of its
kennel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Charlemagne prepared for every emergency. Immediately
upon the receipt of Desiderius&rsquo;s reply, he
began a forward movement. He led the main part
of his army over Mont Cenis by a route which
Desiderius had supposed to be impassable; while
his uncle Bernhard with another division crossed
Mount Joll. The two divisions met at the southern
base of the Alps. No resistance had been offered
except at one spot, and that was easily overcome.
Charlemagne pressed forward without delay, defeated
the Lombard forces of Adalgis and the
Frankish leader Ottocar, and advanced to the siege
of Pavia,<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>
whither Ottocar had fled to join Desiderius.
As the siege might be a long one, Charlemagne
at the head of one division of his army
advanced toward Rome, taking possession, on the
way, of many Roman cities which had fallen into the
hands of the Lombards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>There was as great rejoicing in Rome as there was
consternation among the Lombards at Charlemagne&rsquo;s
victorious progress. Preparations were made to welcome
the rescuer. Ozanam says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On Easter Saturday Charlemagne appeared before the
gates of Rome. The clergy bearing crosses, the senators
and magistrates waving banners, and the children carrying
palm branches and singing hymns, went out to meet
him. He ascended to the Vatican where Pope Hadrian
awaited him. On the following day he donned the tunic
and laticlavium and sat in the court of justice. Military
authority and civil jurisdiction were exercised alike by
patricians.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly after this Charlemagne set out for his
uncle&rsquo;s camp before Pavia. The chronicles of St.
Gall describe his arrival. Desiderius, who was shut
in there, mounted a high tower with Ottocar, from
which he espied Charlemagne&rsquo;s army approaching in
the distance. At first they saw only the war machines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not Charlemagne there with this great expedition?&rdquo;
asked Desiderius.</p>
<p>Ottocar replied that he was not.</p>
<p>But when Desiderius saw the large force of warriors
following, he said, &ldquo;Surely Charlemagne is
among that multitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; said Ottocar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what shall we do,&rdquo; said Desiderius, who
was growing very anxious, &ldquo;if he should come with
a still greater number of soldiers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking, the bodyguards appeared,
at sight of whom the panic-stricken Desiderius cried
out, &ldquo;There comes Charlemagne.&rdquo;
Ottocar again assured him he was not there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Then came bishops, abb&eacute;s, the clergy of the royal
chapel, and the grandees. Desiderius exclaimed
with a groan, &ldquo;Let us hide ourselves in the bowels
of the earth, far away from the sight of this terrible
enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had he uttered these words when they saw
something in the west like a black cloud driven by
the northeast wind. The glimmer of weapons foretold
a day for the doomed city as dark as night.
Then Charlemagne himself appeared&mdash;that man of
iron, iron-helmeted and gauntleted, his breast and
shoulders in coat of iron mail, with lance uplifted
in his right hand, his left grasping his sword-hilt.</p>
<p>Famine and pestilence forced the surrender of the
city. Desiderius was deposed and his throne declared
forfeited, and he was sent first to Luttich and
thence to the monastery of Corvey,<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> where he was
compelled to spend his remaining days in the exercise
of penance. His son, Adalgis, escaped a like
fate by flight. After the surrender the Archbishop
of Milan crowned Charlemagne with the Iron Crown,
so called because a nail from the Cross, said to have
been brought by the Empress H&eacute;l&egrave;ne from Jerusalem,
was set among its jewels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Immediately after the coronation, Paulus Diaconus,<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a>
famous as a historian, tried to incite revolt.
He was arrested, brought before the military court,
and sentenced to a shameful death. Charlemagne,
however, did not execute the penalty. He admired
the man for his patriotism and gave him his freedom.
He established a constitution and laws for the Lombards,
and after settling the affairs of their kingdom,
received news of the Saxon uprising.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The First Eleven Years of the Saxon War</span></h2>
<p>We must now consider the longest and most
desperate of Charlemagne&rsquo;s wars&mdash;that
waged against the Saxons, which began
before his campaign against Desiderius and lasted
not less than thirty-three years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>A bitter race antagonism had long prevailed between
the Franks and the Saxons. As already related,
the latter had been subjugated by Charlemagne&rsquo;s
predecessors and forced to pay tribute. Saxony
extended along both sides of the Weser, westerly
to the vicinity of the lower Rhine, southwesterly
to the Harz<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> and the Unstrut,<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> and northerly to
the ocean, except the country occupied by the
Frisians. Four races inhabited Saxony&mdash;the Westphalians,
living between the Weser and the Issel;
the Eastphalians, on the right bank of the Weser to
the Elbe; the Eugen, between both these; and the
Northmen, or Nordalbingi,<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> who lived on both sides
of the Elbe. &ldquo;Phalen&rdquo; or &ldquo;Falen&rdquo; means a great
plain, and one of these names (Westphalia) is in
use to-day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The Saxons were not far advanced in civilization.
The hatred which they entertained against the Germans,
who had been converted to Christianity by
Boniface<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> and other missionaries, had caused them
to break off friendly intercourse with their ancestral
associates. They worshipped Odin and other
heathen divinities in their forests, as of old. Charlemagne
conducted his campaign against them, not so
much in the interest of religion as to overthrow the
power of a dangerous neighbor, before he went to
Italy to subjugate Desiderius. He invaded Saxony
and occupied Eresburg, in the vicinity of which was
Irminsul, the mystic idol revered by the Saxons.<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a>
Its significance is still doubtful. Some maintain
that it typified the world-ash tree &ldquo;Ygdrasil,&rdquo; whose
trunk, the Germans believed, was rooted in the
underworld and whose branches shadowed Odin&rsquo;s
palace, Walhalla. Others contend that it was a
memorial of Arminius who freed Germany from the
Roman yoke. The Irminsul was demolished by the
Franks. The Saxons at last sued for peace, which
Charlemagne granted after they had given him
twelve hostages. Then he retired with his army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>After this opening success over the Saxons, Charlemagne
began his campaign against Desiderius; but
hardly had he deposed the Lombardian King before
he received the news that the Saxons, in violation of
their promise to remain peaceable, had invaded
Hesse and were laying it waste. He appeared among
them so suddenly and in such force that they were
again easily overcome. Once more they submitted,
sent him hostages, and were pardoned. It was not
his good fortune, however, to enjoy the fruits of
victory long. An uprising in Italy, led by Adalgis,
son of Desiderius, who had previously escaped, as
has been related, next confronted him. Adalgis betook
himself to the court of the Greek Emperor to
seek his assistance, and made an alliance with his
brother-in-law Arighis, Duke of Benevento,<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> who had
married the rejected Desiderata. By this alliance he
secured the help of the other Italian nobles, who
had been left undisturbed upon condition of remaining
loyal. The landing of Adalgis with his
Greek auxiliaries was the signal for an uprising.
Upon receipt of the news of his enemy&rsquo;s designs
from the Pope, Charlemagne hastened to Italy.
Only one of the nobles, however, Duke Rotgund in
Friaul, had ventured to take up arms, and he was
quickly defeated, taken prisoner, and made to do
penance the rest of his life. The remaining nobles
were stripped of their possessions and the country
was divided into earldoms, governed by Frankish
nobles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>As soon as the Saxons learned that Charlemagne
was engaged in Italy, throwing their promises to
the winds, they rose again, destroyed a number of
Christian churches, and advanced to lay siege to
Eresburg, which was occupied by the Franks.
Failing to capture the stronghold by assault, they
resorted to trickery. By a pretended retreat they
induced the Franks to make a sally, then turned
upon them, slaughtered them, and demolished the
fortress. A few of the garrison saved themselves by
flight to Siegburg on the Ruhr,<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> which was attacked
by the Saxons without success. Charlemagne, in
the meantime, having returned from Italy, suddenly
appeared in Saxony and overcame all opposition.
He once more pardoned those who implored mercy,
restored Eresburg, and built the fortress of Lippestadt.
To appease the King, several of the nobles,
among them Bruno, son-in-law of Wittekind,<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> accepted
Christian baptism and remained as hostages
with the King. Charlemagne did not avenge this
disloyalty upon his hostages, but continued his
efforts to overcome opposition by mild measures
which were not altogether satisfactory to his leaders.
In his opinion the time had not yet come to undertake
forcible conversions, for he was convinced that
Christian belief and faith could not be imposed by
violence. He was fully resolved to Christianize the
Saxons, but he had other methods in view of bringing
about that result. He was equally determined
that the Saxons should become a political element
in the great German nation, but he was cautious
about taking any measures that were not absolutely
necessary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>It was Charlemagne&rsquo;s custom to call an annual
assembly of the leaders of his people upon the
Champ de Mai<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> to discuss affairs of state. He
decided that year (777) to hold it in Saxony, and
selected for its locality the district at the source of
the Lippe near Paderborn. He hoped the Saxons
would regard this gathering as a peace measure.
Their leaders were invited to participate and appeared
in a body, with the exception of Wittekind,
who bitterly hated the Franks. He had escaped
after the defeat; and as Adalgis sought assistance
from the Greek Emperor, so he appealed to his
brother-in-law Siegfried, King of Denmark, to aid
him.</p>
<p>The Saxon chiefs beheld Charlemagne for the
first time in the majesty of peaceful surroundings.
Heroes of the sword and dignitaries of the Church
were gathered around his throne. Many of these
chiefs willingly acknowledged such a master. It
happened also that a Moorish Embassy from Spain
was in Paderborn at this time. The Saxons beheld
the newcomers with astonishment, so different was
their splendid attire from that of the northern
peoples. The Moorish leaders had come to seek the
help of Charlemagne against Abderrahman, Caliph
of Cordova, and promised to transfer their allegiance
to him in case he freed them from his power. Charlemagne
was glad of the opportunity to interpose in
Spanish affairs. He promised to help the petitioners,
and in the meantime decided to demand a district
in northern Spain for himself as a defence, in case of
emergency, against the Moors of the southern part.
The Saxons for the first time realized the wide extent
of his authority and fame. How could they longer
withstand him, they asked themselves. Ozanam says:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Many of them swore allegiance and promised to surrender
their country and their freedom if they violated
their word. Many renounced idol worship and were
baptized. A multitude of men, women, and children
went down to the river in white garments, accompanied
by chanting priests, and came back Christians; at their
head the priests and monks, who had thus laid the foundations
of the Christian Saxon Church. The world rejoiced
at the conversion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No one was more delighted than Charlemagne.
It heightened his hope and enthusiasm when he set
out upon the Spanish expedition the following year.
He crossed the Pyrenees, overcame Pampeluna and
Barcelona, and made Navarre, Aragon, and Catalonia
subject to his authority. Saragossa was next
invested, and after a short resistance its people submitted
to him and gave hostages and tribute. Thereupon
he made northeastern Spain, as far as the Ebro,
the limit of the Frankish kingdom in Spain, and
established a barrier against the Moors, intending
thereby to discourage pagan invasions and prevent
the disturbance of the Christian world, as his grandfather
had done before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Unfortunate news from home forced Charlemagne
to leave Spain. While crossing the Pyrenees a part
of his army met with serious disaster. The rear
guard, led by Roland, was ambushed in a narrow
valley near Roncesvalles by the Basques and slaughtered
to the last man. It was impossible to offer
resistance, for the enemy occupied an impregnable
position on the heights, from which they rolled down
huge rocks and hurled showers of missiles. The
hero Roland and his brave comrades, the paladin
Anschelm and the seneschal Eckart, who were
slain, were celebrated at a later period in song and
romance. Charlemagne undoubtedly would have
turned back to avenge them had not a new Saxon
uprising forced him to return as speedily as possible.
He soon defeated the Saxons and laid waste their
country to the Elbe. The usual result followed.
Wittekind fled, the Saxons took the oath of allegiance
and gave securities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Charlemagne well knew that the roots of the
Saxon animosity were grounded in their heathen religion.
He determined to eradicate it by force. His
scheme was to pardon only those who consented to
be baptized and to remain faithful to the Christian
faith. Death should be the penalty of participation
in the heathen service. Forcible measures of this
kind, imposed for the purpose of changing ideas and
sentiments, are improper, it is true; but under existing
circumstances it seemed the only preventive of
their constant uprisings. It also promised to be of
great advantage, as the younger generation would
be influenced by the abandonment of the heathen
religion to become loyal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Charlemagne not only determined to introduce
Christianity, but Frankish laws as well. Saxony
was divided into districts to which Frankish chiefs
were assigned. He deemed it of the highest importance
that a people who had violated their obligations
so frequently should be restrained by severe
measures. The immediate outcome of this, however,
was the almost complete destruction of a division
of the Frankish army and the massacre of four
princes and twenty distinguished nobles, by the
Saxons, led by Wittekind and his brother Albion.
Charlemagne&rsquo;s grief at their loss was as intense as
his anger against the Saxons. His patience was
exhausted. He determined that justice should be
inexorable in dealing with these murderers and perjurers.
If he overlooked their bloody deed it would
only incite the Saxons to perpetrate fresh atrocities.
He determined to execute a penalty severe enough
to intimidate the Saxons ever after, and to protect
those who might be exposed to danger if the guilty
went free. Charlemagne acted upon the theory that
a judge who releases a murderer is equally guilty
if that murderer commits fresh crimes. He put
down the uprising at once; and when the Saxons as
usual implored mercy and charged Wittekind (who
had again fled) with the blame, he demanded the
surrender of the guilty persons. They were tried
by a military court, found guilty, and beheaded.
Four thousand five hundred in one day! This was
the massacre at Verden!<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a>&mdash;a grewsome deed!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Wittekind&rsquo;s Baptism</span></h2>
<p>Notwithstanding their many defeats and
the massacre at Verden, the Saxons were not
completely subjugated. Infuriated by that
dreadful event, Wittekind and the Saxon leaders incited
another uprising and began a war of revenge.
Charlemagne in consequence was forced to use more
strenuous measures than before. Two desperate
battles were fought, one at Detmold, which was not
decisive, and the other at Hesse, between the Ems
and the Weser, in which the Saxons, who fought
with almost unexampled bravery, were completely
routed. Charlemagne removed ten thousand Saxons
with their women and children to Brabant and Flanders,
where they found new homes, their old ones
having been turned over to Frankish settlers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>The King was now fully determined to put an end
to any further opposition by making an offensive
campaign. Hitherto the Saxons had been the aggressors,
but this year (784) he invaded Saxony and advanced
as far as the Elbe. There he learned that
Wittekind and Albion were on the opposite shore
of the river and that they were desirous of opening
negotiations with him. Accordingly he sent messengers
to them promising them safe conduct if they
wished to meet him. Wittekind sent back word
that they were ready to tender allegiance and to
be baptized, whereupon Charlemagne arranged for a
meeting at his castle at Attigny.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> When they arrived
they were received so graciously that the King&rsquo;s
kindness offset the bitter necessity which had forced
them to submit.</p>
<p>The reconciliation of Charlemagne and Wittekind
amply justified the former&rsquo;s attitude toward the
Saxons. Wittekind, in the presence of the great
King, whose majesty and graciousness impressed him
and whose words animated him with a new spirit,
felt that had he been in Charlemagne&rsquo;s place he
should have acted as the King had done. In view
of the event at Attigny, those who criticised Charlemagne
were dwarfs whose weak eyes could not see
above his sword belt, much less appreciate the majestic
spirit that shone in his kingly face. In their own
name and in the name of their people, Wittekind
and Albion vowed allegiance and were baptized,
together with a great number of Saxons. Geva,
the wife of Wittekind, who accompanied him, was
also baptized. Charlemagne regarded that day at
Attigny as the most fortunate in his career. Wittekind,
his wife Geva, and Albion were loaded down
with gifts and left for their homes escorted by a
guard of honor. In a letter to the Pope, Charlemagne
requested that a thanksgiving festival be
ordered in commemoration of the event.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>It is related in the tradition concerning Wittekind&rsquo;s
baptism that he subsequently came in disguise to the
castle when Charlemagne was celebrating the Christmas
festival, and that what he saw and heard there
removed the last vestige of his heathen belief and
left him a true Christian.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Thassilo and the Avars</span></h2>
<p>Charlemagne now realized that the time
had come for him to deal with Thassilo,
Duke of Bavaria, a somewhat difficult
matter because of their near relationship, Thassilo
being, as already stated, Pepin&rsquo;s nephew. The Duke
was not only secretly conspiring against Charlemagne
in Italy, but he was also in communication
with the leaders of the Slavs and Thuringians, urging
them to resist Charlemagne&rsquo;s authority. His most
serious offence, however, was his effort to induce
the Avars<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> to assist in the war against the King.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Charlemagne, learning of the intrigues in Italy,
appeared there much sooner than his enemies had
anticipated, and easily thwarted their designs; after
which he went to Rome and attended the Easter
festival (787). Fearing that Charlemagne might
discover all his secret plottings, Thassilo sent messengers
to the Pope asking him to take steps to
bring about a reconciliation between himself and
the King. The Pope, however, uncertain whether
he was in earnest or simply wished to gain time, not
only refused to comply with his request, but sent
word to him that if he violated his solemn promises
or evaded them in any way the ban would be pronounced
against him.</p>
<p>After his return Charlemagne summoned a parliament
at Worms and laid Thassilo&rsquo;s case before
it. His refusal to appear only aggravated his guilt.
War was declared against him. Three Frankish
armies invaded Bavaria, two of them led by the
King&rsquo;s sons, Carl and Pepin, the third by Charlemagne
in person. Thassilo was taken by surprise,
for he had intended to begin his operations later.
Neither the discontented Thuringians, who were in
league with him, nor the Slavs and Avars, came to
his help. Thassilo&rsquo;s wife, Luitberger, daughter of
Desiderius, had persistently urged her husband to
make war against Charlemagne, and when too late
she realized the folly of her advice and the danger
which threatened Thassilo. The Bavarians themselves
were not eager to fight, and indeed expressed
more confidence in Charlemagne than in their Duke.
Under these discouraging circumstances Thassilo
deemed it wisest to betake himself to Charlemagne&rsquo;s
camp and implore his pardon. He was exceedingly
penitent and tendered his sceptre to the King, saying
that he had forfeited any right to hold it longer.
Charlemagne invested Thassilo with the dukedom
in fee and took hostages from him, among them his
son, Theudo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Delighted that he had escaped this danger, Thassilo
went to Regensburg and Charlemagne returned
home. But Thassilo had hardly come under his
wife&rsquo;s influence again when he violated his promise
and resumed his hostile machinations. He summoned
the leaders of his people to Regensburg, denounced
his royal cousin, reviled him, and openly
declared he would not respect a compulsory promise
even if it cost him ten sons. The foolish Duke did
not realize how contemptible he made himself by
his conduct in the eyes of all honest men. He
renewed negotiations with the Avars and induced
them to join him. One division of the barbarians
was led by Thassilo through Bavarian territory into
the Frankish kingdom, and a second into Italy; but
both armies were defeated by Carl, who was sent
against them by the King.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Justice at last overtook Thassilo. He was summoned
to appear before the Parliament at Ingelheim.
The defeat of the Avars had so completely
demoralized him that he did not dare to disobey
the summons. He failed to clear himself from the
charge of treason. His own followers testified
against him. The indictment against him which
called for the severest penalty was based upon this
article in the Frankish statutes: &ldquo;Whoever shall
fail to keep faith with the kingdom, whoever shall
break his vows to the King, whoever shall ally himself
with the enemies of the kingdom, shall forfeit
his life.&rdquo; The death penalty was unanimously pronounced.
Charlemagne asked him what he would
do if his life were spared; whereupon Thassilo, as a
proof of his repentance, agreed to spend the rest of
his days in a monastery, received the tonsure at St.
Goar, and was sent from there to Fulda.<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> Charlemagne
declared his ducal title extinguished, assigned
Frankish counts to the districts of Bavaria, and incorporated
it in the Frankish kingdom.</p>
<p>The year 790 was one long remembered by the
Franks, for it was the only peaceable year in Charlemagne&rsquo;s
long reign. Preparations, however, had to be
made to punish the Avars and prevent raids in future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The Avars, living between the Enns<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> and the
Sau,<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a> were of Hunnish stock, for which reason they
are sometimes called Huns in the old chronicle.
They inherited not only the pillaging habits of their
ancestors, who swept over Germany like a deluge
in the fifth century, but the almost countless treasures,
or a considerable part of the treasure, which
their fathers had stolen. The defences which they
built on their frontiers were of a peculiar kind. They
were called &ldquo;rings&rdquo;; each one of them was sufficiently
large to enclose a number of villages, and consisted
of strong walls, ten feet high and as many wide, constructed
of tree-trunks and rocks cemented together
and surmounted by densely planted thorn bushes.
Behind such walls, the Avars thought they were secure
against any enemy; but they were soon to learn
their mistake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Charlemagne reviewed his forces at Regensburg
before entering upon his campaign. Upon this
occasion he buckled a sword around his third son
Ludwig, then thirteen years of age, who was to take
part in the expedition. He moved along both banks
of the Danube in an easterly direction, while Pepin
made his advance from Italy. The Khan of the
Avars attacked the latter and was defeated in a
bloody battle. When Charlemagne reached the
Enns he heard the news and invaded the enemy&rsquo;s
country at once. Several rings were carried by
storm, the contents of the treasure vaults removed,
the villages devastated, and large numbers of prisoners
were taken. A sickness which broke out
among the army horses forced the King to retire
sooner then he had intended. The war, however,
lasted some years longer before the enemy was entirely
subjugated. The decisive battle occurred in
the year 796. The rings which Pepin had reconstructed,
as well as those which remained in possession
of the enemy after the first expedition, were
taken by assault. Wien<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> was one of the principal
localities occupied by the Avars. Charlemagne
made the Avar country the Oestmark of the kingdom,
subsequently called Oesterrichi and at a later
period Oesterreich.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Coronation at Rome</span></h2>
<p>Pope Hadrian died at the close of the year
795. Charlemagne was so overcome by the
death of the venerable prelate that he shed
tears when the sad news was told him. Hadrian had
looked upon him as the defender of the Church;
and in his relations to the King there was not a
trace of that ambition which characterized later
Popes, to the detriment of Christianity.</p>
<p>Hadrian&rsquo;s successor, Leo the Third, hastened to
ingratiate himself with Charlemagne. He notified
the King of his election and sent him a consecrated
silver key as a symbol of his recognition of Charlemagne,
both as the ruler of Roman territory and as
a world sovereign.</p>
<p>It is of importance to understand the relations
existing between Charlemagne and the Popes, for
they were very different from those which existed
between the later Popes and the German rulers. A
letter of congratulation sent to Leo by Charlemagne
throws some light upon them. It begins:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have read the letter from Your Highness and
listened to the decretals, and we heartily congratulate
you upon your unanimous election, the dutiful
obedience of your people, and your promises of
loyalty to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the next few years there were outbreaks
in Saxony and Spain. Wittekind and Albion remained
faithful to their promises; but not so some
of their people. The disturbances, however, were
quelled without much difficulty. The Moors in
Spain, also, who had gained some advantages, were
speedily overcome.</p>
<p>In the year 799 an assault was made upon Pope Leo
during a street procession. It was badly managed,
however. The leaders of the mob had planned to
blind the Pope and cut out his tongue, but they
only succeeded in cutting him in the face. The
Pope&rsquo;s friends rescued him and conducted him to
a safe place of concealment. The clerical officials,
Paschal and Campulus, relatives of Hadrian, who were
in attendance upon Leo, had been requested by the
Pope not to officiate during the procession. He little
dreamed of their treachery, for they were the abettors
of the assault. The Duke of Spoleto, being informed
of the outrage, proceeded at once to Rome with armed
followers and escorted Leo to one of his castles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>As soon as his wounds healed, Leo betook himself
to Germany personally to implore Charlemagne&rsquo;s
assistance. At Nuremberg he learned that the King
was holding court at Paderborn, and thither he
hastened. Before he could reach the city, news of
his approach was conveyed to the King, who at once
began preparations to give him an honorable reception.
He sent Archbishop Hildebrand and Count
Auschar to meet him, but this was only the beginning
of the ceremonies he had arranged. As Leo
neared the city, a troop of cavalry went out to
escort him. The King&rsquo;s son, Pepin, greeted him and
conducted him to the plaza, where Charlemagne sat
upon the throne in royal state in the midst of his
dignitaries. Rising and outstretching his arms, the
King stepped down, embraced the Pope, and led him
by the hand as he blessed the kneeling people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>On the following day Leo related to the King the
details of the murderous plot against him, of which
the scars on his face bore evidence, and informed
him that the conspirators had sought to justify their
act by spreading base calumnies against him. He
closed by asking Charlemagne&rsquo;s help. The King
replied that he could not personally accompany him
to Rome, because of fresh disquiet in Saxony and
the Spanish Mark, but he would furnish him an
escort headed by Frankish chiefs, and promised to
go to Rome personally as soon as possible. When
the Pope&rsquo;s enemies learned that Charlemagne had
received him, their courage failed them. Leo was
greeted with imposing ceremonies, and Paschal and
Campulus were thrown into prison by the Franks.</p>
<p>The Saxon and Spanish affairs having been settled
by the close of the next year (800), Charlemagne,
mindful of his promise, went to Rome. The Pope
met him at Novonte and had a private interview
with him, at which a memorable event, soon to
occur, doubtless was discussed. The Pope then returned
to Rome to make preparations for Charlemagne&rsquo;s
reception, and on December sixth the King
entered the city. His reception was an imposing
one. The people welcomed him with their civic banners,
the air was rent with loyal shouts, and the
Pope, surrounded by the dignitaries of the Church,
met him in front of St. Peter&rsquo;s, which he entered
accompanied by the music of the Papal choir. This
was only the prelude to the memorable ceremony
for which preparations had been quietly made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Charlemagne began his magisterial duties in Rome
by conducting an inquiry into the assault upon Leo.
The calumnies were proved baseless; but as the Pope
wished personally to establish his innocence, Charlemagne
summoned an assembly of the clerical and
secular dignitaries and called upon anyone who had
accusations to make against the Pope to appear
and state them. No one appeared. Thereupon, to
purify himself of all offence, the Pope declared he
would make purgation by oath. He rose and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The all-gracious and powerful King Charlemagne
came with his prelates and princes to investigate
these charges. In the presence of all here, in the
presence of God and His angels, who know our inmost
souls, and in the presence of Saint Peter, prince
of the apostles, I, Leo, head of the Holy Roman
Church, declare that I am guiltless of the charges
made against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then passed a death sentence upon the conspirators,
but Charlemagne subsequently mitigated
the penalty. Paschal and Campulus were sent to a
monastery for penance and their confederates were
placed under the ban.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>At last the memorable event occurred which made
Charlemagne the ruler of the Christian world. High
mass was celebrated by the Pope in the Vatican on
the first day of the Christmas season in the year 800.
Charlemagne, in the elegant attire of a Roman patrician,
knelt before the shrine of the apostle Peter.
Suddenly the Pope descended the altar steps, placed
a golden crown upon the King&rsquo;s head, draped him
with the royal purple, and in a loud voice proclaimed:
&ldquo;Long life and success to the pious Charlemagne,
sublime and peace-loving Roman Emperor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The choirs sang and the multitude shouted, &ldquo;Long
live the divinely crowned Augustus Carl, great and
pious Roman Emperor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The anointing of Charlemagne as Roman Emperor,
and of his son Pepin as King of Italy, closed the
ceremony.</p>
<p>It was an event of extraordinary significance. It
was not a mere spectacle or a comedy planned by
Leo for purposes of deception, as some historians
have asserted. Charlemagne would never have consented
to such mummery; for he was a giant not
only in body but in soul, and was always swayed
by lofty purpose. He regarded the ceremony performed
that day in the Vatican as one of serious
moment. It is not conceivable that Pope Leo conferred
this extraordinary honor upon his rescuer
merely for his own advantage. Charlemagne had
always shown that he felt he was called upon to
exert all his power for the strengthening and extension
of Christianity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>It must be taken into consideration that at that
period hardly a fourth of Europe had been converted;
that the Christian world in the south was
threatened by the Mohammedans, in the north by
the heathen Normans, and in the east by the Slavs
and other pagans. From the earliest times the
Eastern emperors had made claims upon Italy, and
the Pope had not been protected until Pepin and
Charlemagne appeared. Considering these things,
and the dangerous situation, can anyone blame Leo
for proclaiming the Frankish King, who had saved
him before all the world, as the all-powerful champion
of Christendom, and for conferring upon him a
title which would impress all people as the commemoration
of a great deed? It was this last consideration
which induced Charlemagne to accept the
title. He detested all outward display. Wherever
he went he wore his plain military costume, but
when he represented the people upon public occasions
he did not despise show. He never underestimated
the effect of personal appearance upon
the people, and he well knew what the effect of this
title would be. It was full of meaning to the people;
but its significance to him was the completion of
the great mission he had contemplated. As to the
motives actuating him, M. Carri&egrave;re well says:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Charlemagne made the deeds and achievements of
his grandfather and father the foundation of a lofty
historical work. His soul was exalted with the ideal of
a Roman empire and Christian German nation. Henceforth
he devoted all his energies to the work of uniting
the Germans in one organic whole. He brought not only
Bavaria, but Saxony under German authority. From the
Eider to the Tiber, from the Ebro to the Drau, his authority
was absolute. When the Pope placed the imperial
crown upon his head, it was the symbol of the work of
culture the Germans would carry on in Rome, and a
token that the new city should be a Christian city, representing
God&rsquo;s Kingdom on earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Victories of Peace</span></h2>
<p>It seems almost incredible that a prince who was
obliged to undertake so many and such prolonged
campaigns&mdash;that against the Saxons
alone requiring twenty-six expeditions&mdash;could have
had any opportunity to engage in works of peace.
The question must arise how he found the time, or
the opportunity, or the encouragement for other
operations than those of a warlike nature.</p>
<p>Succeeding events will supply the answer. From
the point of view of his wars, the Emperor has been
called a conqueror; but when we come to consider
his peace achievements and his creative ability, it
will be shown that he had a still clearer right to that
appellation. It will also clearly reveal his ideals of
sovereignty, and we shall recognize the propriety
of the title history has accorded him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>First of all, let us consider the place which was
the favorite resort of the Emperor during the last
twenty years of his life. He lived at Aix-la-Chapelle
nearly all the time when he was not in the field.
Its gently sloping heights, spurs of the Eifel and
Ardennes, at that time densely wooded, enclosed
a fruitful valley. A royal palace stood there in
Pepin&rsquo;s time; and even if Charlemagne was not
born there, as is sometimes asserted, yet it is certain
that he spent the most of his boyhood amid
these scenes.</p>
<p>Bathing was one of his favorite pleasures, and
many a time he breasted the blue waves of the
Rhine. The warm mineral baths at Aix-la-Chapelle
were his especial delight. There were also thickly
wooded spots in the vicinity which attracted him.
He was as fond of hunting as of bathing, even in
his last years; and his retainers, as well as his beautiful
and buxom daughters, often joined him in the
hunt, and chased the buffaloes and wild boars to
the clang of horns and the baying of hounds. All
great human personages excite the imagination of
those who come under their influence; and the
popular fancy is fond of weaving stories about them
which help to reveal their true character. One of
these legends concerns the baths at Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>At Charlemagne&rsquo;s palace in Mainz there was a
bell which was said to ring whenever any danger
was threatened. Charlemagne heard its clang one
day and sent a messenger to ascertain the cause.
He found that a snake had coiled itself around
the rope and was the bell-ringer. The snake led
the messenger to its nest, where a noxious toad was
found squatting upon the snake&rsquo;s eggs. He drove
the toad away and then informed the Emperor
of the curious event. Charlemagne&rsquo;s astonishment
was further increased when the snake suddenly
appeared in the hall, wriggled along to his table,
ascended it, dropped a sparkling jewel which it
carried in its jaws into a wine glass, and then quickly
disappeared. The magic stone, upon which swan
and runic symbols were engraved, had mysterious
properties. Whoever received the gift became the
object of the passionate adoration of the giver.
Charlemagne placed the stone in a ring and sent it
to his beloved wife Fastrada. Immediately he became
more closely attached to her than ever before.
He could not be away from her. When her death
removed her from his side, he was overcome with
grief. Her body was placed in an open coffin in
the Cathedral, and the Emperor spent his time
there and would not suffer it to be buried. The
people whispered among themselves, &ldquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s
mind is affected by his love for Fastrada. What
will become of his crown and country if this grief
continues?&rdquo; In this emergency the pious Turpin
had a dream which suggested a method of deliverance.
He rose from his bed, donned his clothes,
and hastened to the Cathedral. It was apparently
empty. Before the altar there was a lofty sarcophagus,
upon which the Empress rested. Round about
it upon the floor lay a band of paladins garbed
as penitents. In front of the sarcophagus stood
the Emperor weeping, with his head resting upon
the coffin. Turpin ascended the steps. He gently
raised Fastrada&rsquo;s ermine covering, seized the hand
so long cold, and quietly removed the ring; whereupon
the paladins, who had been kneeling in prayer,
looked about in astonishment. The Emperor lifted
his head and addressed them. &ldquo;How long have we
mourned? Too long, surely! Where is my chancellor?
It seems to me my people are calling. Let
the Empress be buried in the earth, never to be
forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The magic swan ring now exerted its influence
in a new way. The Emperor became devotedly
attached to the prelate, and the latter was troubled
over its demoralizing influence. He went to Aix-la-Chapelle,
followed by the Emperor, and threw the
ring into a quiet forest lake made by the warm
springs. From that time the place became the favorite
resort of the Emperor. He erected a castle in
the midst of the lake, in which he often meditated
upon the frailty of earthly things. He took delight
in bathing in the waters in whose depths the swan
ring, taken from the hand of his beloved, rested
without his knowledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>At Aix-la-Chapelle he also built a majestic palace,
surrounded by a broad columned portico, which was
a marvel of architecture at that time. Rome and
Ravenna furnished the columns, the marble blocks,
and the mosaic work, and the best architects were
sent there by the Pope. Around it were buildings
for the schools, court attendants, and bodyguards;
farther away, a cloister and farmhouses; and still
farther off a tall structure built over the warm baths
and capable of accommodating hundreds. The most
majestic building of all was a minster connected
with the palace by a pillared passageway, the dome
of which, supported by tall columns, was adorned
with a representation of Christ and the four-and-twenty
elders of the Apocalypse in mosaic upon a
gold background, the altars glistening with gold and
silver ornaments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Everything was carried out according to the plans
of the Emperor; and even when he was in the field
the work went on. He devoted himself assiduously
to all sacred matters. In the early morning hours
he might be seen passing along the portico to the
church to meditate and strengthen himself for his
official duties, and at evening he returned for the
same high purpose.</p>
<p>Those who attended this hero of the spiritual
when the times were opportune for deeds of peace
often accompanied the hero of the sword upon his
expeditions. During his first Lombard campaign he
became acquainted with the pious and learned Anglo-Saxon
prelate, Alcuin,<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> and took him with him that
he might have the advantage of his counsels and
teaching. Charlemagne, like all princes&rsquo; sons in
those days, had enjoyed but little instruction up to
the time he assumed the sovereignty. His native
ability helped him over many hard places, but that
same ability inspired him with a passionate desire to
avail himself of the treasures of knowledge. The
great Emperor sat, a willing scholar, at the feet of
his teacher Alcuin, whom Guizot thus describes:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Alcuin was very well versed in Antonius and Hieronymus
and was familiar with Pythagoras, Aristotle,
Aristippus, Diogenes, Plato, Homer, Virgil, Seneca, and
Pliny. His writings were chiefly theological, but he had
also done much of importance in mathematics, astronomy,
dialectics, and rhetoric. This man was the light of the
Church in his day and was also a classical scholar.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other members of the scholarly circle at his court
were Angilbert, Eginhard, Theodulph, Peter of Pisa,
and the Lombard historian Paulus Warnefried. The
last, as already has been stated, had been condemned
to death for inciting revolt in his country, but was
pardoned by Charlemagne, who subsequently conferred
many honors upon him. How highly Charlemagne
esteemed art and science is shown by the fact
that he attended the sessions of the academy and was
recognized as an equal among its members. He
would not allow court ceremonials to be conducted
in halls devoted to the service of science. In order
to preserve and foster the culture of former times,
the members at his request took the names of famous
ancients. Alcuin was called Horace; Eginhard, Callippus;
Angilbert, Homer; Theodulph, Pindar; and
Charlemagne&mdash;the hero, champion of the Church,
and lover of the lyre&mdash;was unanimously called David.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">

<p class="caption"><i>CHARLEMAGNE and Alcuin</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Charlemagne was endowed with extraordinary
natural gifts of language; his studies, which he pursued
at night, both at home and in the field, enabled
him in an exceedingly short time to converse as
fluently in Latin as in his mother tongue. He
studied the works of the great Roman historians,
Julius C&aelig;sar, Sallust, Livy, Tacitus, and others;
and besides this, during his Roman expeditions, he
had viewed the scenes of the exploits described by
them and the ruins of ancient stateliness. The
Grecian world also had revealed to him the brilliant
culture of the great men of that country. He was
so well acquainted with the Greek language that he
could read the literature in the original, which disclosed
to him visions of the beauty of that Eden.
Rome stood high in his estimation, but Athens
higher; and higher than either Rome or Athens,
Jerusalem, as the source of those sacred teachings
which are to humanity what the sun is to the earth&mdash;light-diffuser
and inspiration of newly created life.
He never wandered from the true path, whose course
is so often confused by mistaken teachers even to this
day. With unwavering faith he anticipated the complete
victory of the light and was ready at all times
to serve the sacred cause with all his energy. He
often manifested his sincere interest in the Academy.
He ardently longed to create a new Athens at Aix-la-Chapelle
by his own efforts, assisted by his friends,
and to make this new Athens the centre of a Christian
spirit which should be a light to all the nations.
He founded training schools and schools for youth.
He organized a school at the court for the sons of
his generals and officials. He supervised every detail,
so that there should be no question of their success,
and invited the assistance of others. The great
Emperor was not ashamed to avail himself of the
critical knowledge acquired by the results of education.
The chronicles of Saint Gall contain the following
interesting instance of this:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>It happened that the sons of those of the middle
and lower classes exhibited results which surpassed
all his expectations, and that the sons of people of
the higher classes handed in wretched and bungling
compositions. Imitating the example of the highest
Judge, Charlemagne placed the industrious ones on
his right and said to them: &ldquo;I praise you, my
children, for the zeal with which you have carried
out my instructions and because you have done
your best according to your ability. Continue striving
to accomplish still more that you may not fail
to meet my expectations and to have my constant
care.&rdquo; Then he turned his reproachful gaze upon
those at his left and hurled these words at them:
&ldquo;Why is it that you, sons of noblemen, puppets
upon whom have been showered all the gifts of birth
and wealth, have not respected my orders and recognized
my solicitude for your reputation? You
have slighted me and devoted yourselves to effeminate
habits, sports, frivolity, and disgraceful
actions.&rdquo; Raising his arm, he shouted: &ldquo;By
Heaven, there are other things more worthy than
these. Your birth and rank count for little with
me. Listen! If you do not hasten to atone for
your neglect by increased industry, you will never
again enjoy my favor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>He who would achieve greatness in the short span
of life must improve every moment of time. Even
while dressing, Charlemagne busied himself with
state affairs, heard complaints, held receptions, and
made decisions. When he could not sleep at night
he spent much time reading and writing. One may
ask why a man who understood Greek and Latin
and was so well versed in classic literature should
have practised writing. The question has given rise
to many conjectures. Very little attention was paid
to writing in those days. It was mainly confined to
the copying of the letters in the sumptuous editions
then in use. The books with their costly gold and
silver covers, set with precious stones, were genuine
works of art. Guizot says:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;With few books and still less paper, writing was a
luxury as well as a gift. Nearly all instruction was oral,
and writing was not depended upon in study. It is
true Charlemagne did not need to economize in paper;
but his teachers had accustomed themselves to instruct
their pupils with extracts and selections, which were
committed to memory and not written upon tablets.
They did not expect great elaboration of detail from
their scholars and brought their studies to a close without
practising the art which with us is considered the beginning.
The writing and preparation of diplomas was
the work of expert secretaries.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Charlemagne had acquired the art of writing
he thus surpassed the princes and notables of his
time in this also.</p>
<p>The Emperor took special pains at meals that
while the body was nourished the soul and mind
should not be neglected. He was fond of pleasant
entertainment, and if conversation was not so interesting
as he wished, the chaplain would read from
some good book. As gormandizing was distasteful
to him, the dinner consisted of only four courses,
something unheard-of in court life at that time. He
drank but three times at table, and regarded drunkenness
as a vice. He was delighted beyond measure
when surrounded by his own family, something he
rarely enjoyed because of his many campaigns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>An extraordinarily tender relation existed between
Angilbert, who bore the academic name of Homer,
and Charlemagne&rsquo;s beautiful daughter Bertha. Upon
one occasion they sat engaged in pleasant conversation
without noticing that night was approaching.
What might have happened if the Emperor had been
aware of this it is difficult to conjecture. The hours
passed swiftly and daybreak drew near. It was not
a Romeo and Juliet morning of lark and nightingale
greetings to the sun, but a cold winter morning with
freshly fallen snow on the ground. How was Angilbert
to get away without leaving accusing footprints
in the snow? At this juncture, Charlemagne, who
had risen early, went to the window and beheld his
loved daughter Bertha carrying Angilbert on her
back through the snow, after which she returned to
her chamber. Charlemagne kept silent about the
escapade, and it was not until some time afterwards
that he confided to his friend what he had seen that
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>It was devout piety that induced Charlemagne to
build the stately Cathedral. The music of the Italian
masters was heard there for the first time, and the art
of song was fostered by his chapel. The German
language was employed there for the first time in
divine service, much to the surprise of the Franks.
The peal of the organ which Harun-al-Rashid presented
to the Emperor was also first heard there.
The chronicles of Saint Gall, to which we are
indebted for so much interesting information concerning
Charlemagne, relate that &ldquo;the wonderful
instrument, by the aid of its metal action and
leathern bellows, filled the air with resonant thunder
and anon with the soft tones of the lyre, as if worked
by magic.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Wood and stone, music, tapers, and incense, however,
are of little account by themselves. Indeed
they sometimes prove detrimental to the service,
which should be the worship of God in spirit and
in truth. There had been much pomp in the service
before the time of Charlemagne. Indeed, the
churches vied with each other in religious spectacles,
and there was very little change in these matters
among the clericals or laity in his time. When the
clericals had finished their churchly duties they
sought relief from their exertions in worldly pleasures.
They were often seen in courtly attire engaged
in hunting, in military exercises, or riding to
banquets. It was irksome to bishops and abb&eacute;s
when they had to be satisfied with such a table as
Charlemagne set forth. He was determined from
the very first that there should be a radical change
in church observances, and that the first step should
be the establishment of higher standards in the
behavior of clericals, and the suppression of covetousness,
vanity, and personal show among them.
He sternly rebuked a bishop who had provided himself
a golden crozier set with pearls and precious
stones. &ldquo;We expect our pastors to bear the cross
of Christ,&rdquo; he told him, &ldquo;but they abandon their
poor sheep and seek to vie with kings and emperors
in splendor and majesty.&rdquo; He also required them
to evince a spirit of reverence in all their actions.</p>
<p>He assigned a young priest, who came to him
highly recommended, to an important position.
Thereupon the priest mounted his horse which was
standing waiting for him and would have hurried
away to the hunt. Charlemagne called him back
and said: &ldquo;Forsooth, I observe that you are far too
active for a priest. It will be better, therefore, for
you to follow me in my campaigns as a soldier, for
the Kingdom of Heaven is much disturbed by these
storms of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clericals often accompanied him, not for
fighting, but to render spiritual help whenever it
was needed. Certain monks who had distinguished
themselves by works of mercy and the transcribing
of useful books were allowed the privilege of hunting
as exceptions, because he thought they might
strengthen themselves and at the same time secure
skins for book covers, girdles, and gloves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Charlemagne labored incessantly for the highest
interests of Church and State. He held two annual
assemblies, one military and the other of a deliberative
nature, in which these interests were discussed.
It is surprising to find that he held forty-two synods
for that part of the Empire alone, in which church
matters were regulated and educational questions
settled. He issued four hundred and seventy-seven
edicts appertaining to the subjects contained in the
famous &ldquo;Capitularies,&rdquo; besides six hundred and
seventy-four of a political character. Although
many of these are not applicable to modern conditions,
it must be remembered that one time is not
all time; that the wisdom of the lawgiver must be
measured by the conditions of those for whom laws
are made; and that results must be decided upon
their merits or demerits. All his contemporaries
are agreed that his laws resulted in great benefit
for the Empire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>It often happened in these assemblies that when
the decisions of famous men in the olden times
were considered, a feeling of doubt would seize upon
Charlemagne. Upon one such occasion he declared:
&ldquo;Oh that I had twelve such learned advisers as
Hieronymus and Augustine were!&rdquo; To which Alcuin
replied: &ldquo;The ruler of heaven and earth did not have
any, and you are longing for twelve of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlemagne retired to rest burdened with care,
but awoke with fresh hope and new desire for action.
His predecessors had made their first residence in
Paris; he, German in body and soul, much as he
enjoyed the healthiness of Roman life, left for the
banks of the Rhine, and, as has been related, selected
Aix-la-Chapelle as his residence in his latter days.
There was not a detail of public administration which
escaped his attention or upon which he did not
expend his extraordinary creative ability. When it
was necessary he sat in majesty upon his throne.
In the academy he devoted himself with no less
assiduity to the promotion of great truths. Indeed,
it is difficult to say in what capacity he most excelled&mdash;as
a war hero, lawgiver, judge, or teacher. Those
who saw him in plain attire upon one or other of the
royal estates, directing and disposing, might well
imagine that the great Charlemagne perfectly filled
the role of farmer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Under Charlemagne&rsquo;s management the crown
possessions became models of husbandry. Nothing
escaped his attention, and whatever he planned was
successful. The stewards received lists containing
the names of species of corn, kitchen herbs, fruit
trees, medical simples, which were to be planted,
cultivated, and looked after in field and garden. He
ordered poultry, geese, and doves to be kept at the
mills so that the superfluous grain should not be
wasted. He laid out fish-ponds, constructed apiaries,
planted noble vineyards, and introduced improved
methods of wine-making. Nor did he confine himself
to the strictly useful. He arranged for the
keeping of pheasants and peacocks. He cultivated
great quantities of flowers in the beautiful pleasure
gardens. He employed gardeners, fish-masters, and
bee-keepers. He arranged to have experts in the
making of butter and cheese teach the people. Upon
the crown estates as well as upon others, wolf-hunters
were posted, who had to deliver annually a
certain number of skins or suffer a penalty. Whatever
produce from the crown property was unnecessary
for use at the court was sold, and a yearly
account of it was kept. The supervision of the
house stewards extended to the slightest detail.
Charlemagne was far from avaricious. His household
never suffered for lack of anything. Whenever
corn was disposed of he arranged to sell the
measure about a denier below the ordinary price.
He had the highest sense of order in the management
of affairs, and looked upon disorder, whether
in the State, the family, or intellectual matters, as
conducive to disastrous results. He did not live
upon the fat of the land, but upon the abundance
from his own estates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Let us consider the conditions of industry and
business in Charlemagne&rsquo;s Empire. His wars were
in no wise detrimental to material prosperity. Arrow,
missile, and helmet makers, as well as sword
and bow and bullet makers, were in demand. At
the royal palaces there were blacksmiths, armorers,
gold and silver smiths, shoemakers, tailors, millers,
turners, masons, wheelwrights, builders, brass-workers,
tanners, soap-boilers, fowlers, potters,
bakers, joiners, saddlers, net-weavers, coopers, architects,
glass-blowers, parchment makers, painters,
and dyers. After Charlemagne&rsquo;s order that monks
who failed in studies should make themselves useful
as handworkers, there was an active emulation among
all the artisans employed at the palaces, the monasteries,
and in the cities. Ferdinand Pfalz states in
his &ldquo;Scenes in City Life&rdquo; that under Charlemagne,
notwithstanding his frequent wars, the cities enjoyed
material prosperity:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The Rhine, Meuse, and Scheld were crowded with
freight vessels; and at the landing-places, as at Worms,
Mainz, Cologne, Dorstadt, Maestricht, Ghent, and Bruges,
or in the harbors at the mouth of the Scheld there were
busy scenes. The Strasburg merchants shipped down
the Rhine to the sea and the Frisians to Worms. The
great Emperor regarded this expansion of commerce with
delight. The old and patched Roman walls were soon
too restricted for the increasing urban populations.
Churches and seats of the nobility spread out into the
suburbs, which eventually had to be enclosed in a ring of
walls.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Order in housekeeping both in court and state
affairs Charlemagne regarded as vitally necessary to
sovereignty. The whole Empire was divided into
districts and to each district a competent official was
assigned, whose duty it was to see that the Capitularies
were respected. Special judges appeared
from time to time, made examinations, and reported
to the Emperor. In deliberations on the affairs of
the Empire, Charlemagne summoned the leading
feudal owners and the high churchmen in May,
which is the origin of the name &ldquo;Mayfield&rdquo; given
to these meetings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Last Days and Death</span></h2>
<p>It is not remarkable that the fame of such a sovereign
spread far and near throughout the world.
Representatives of all nations were found at his
court. The heathen Avar with braided frontlets, the
haughty Count of Lombardy in silk and peacock
feather, the turbaned Arab, the fierce Saxon, the
lithe Anglo-Saxon, the Bavarian, and the Frank
mingled with white-robed priest, dark-cowled monk,
and gowned Jew. Princes of Asia and Africa contended
for the favor of the great Western Emperor,
among them Harun-al-Rashid (&ldquo;Aaron the Just&rdquo;),
Mohammedan caliph of Asia. Charlemagne had sent
an embassy to this powerful prince, who ruled at
the marvellous city of Bagdad, asking him to extend
his protection to Western Christian pilgrims in Jerusalem.
Harun graciously acceded to this request.
He sent Charlemagne the banner of Jerusalem and
the keys to the Holy Sepulchre as a symbol of his
sovereignty over that city. These gifts were followed
by others, costly gold-embroidered silken
stuffs, frankincense, balsam, and spices, also monkeys
and an elephant. The chronicles state that in return
Charlemagne sent him Spanish horses and
mules and Frisian robes, white, gray, sapphire, and
variegated, besides hounds of the largest and best
kind for chasing and catching lions and tigers.
Charlemagne had a hospital built in Jerusalem where
needy pilgrims could be cared for. Ibrahim, the
African prince who ruled over Mauritius, sent him
a Libyan lion, a Numidian bear, Iberian steel, and
purple from Tyre. Another gift by Harun was a
brass water-clock, which was so constructed that a
hand revolved during the twelve hours; and as each
was completed, brass balls falling upon a metal basin
gave out a clear tone announcing the hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Charlemagne was at this time over sixty years of
age. His white hair and beard added to his majestic
appearance. His fourth wife had recently died, and
he now, upon suggestions from Rome, considered a
union with the Empress Irene of Greece. The real
nefariousness of this woman was not revealed until
later; and at this time the Emperor knew no reason
why he should not marry her. But it is to be remembered
that in every action Charlemagne conducted
himself not as a private person, but as the
ruler of a great empire. The only question which
arose in his mind was whether such a union would
accrue to the advantage of the Christian world and
his own people. He decided that it would, and entered
upon the preliminaries of a settlement. Then
came news of the dethronement of Irene and her
banishment to Lesbos&mdash;an event which was subsequently
justified and which proved to be very
fortunate for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>An agreement was made with the Saxons in the
year 803 at Selz on the Saale, which secured peace
for the future. In consideration of the restoration
of their old rights and customs they promised to refrain
from any resistance to the spread and maintenance
of Christianity in Saxony, and to accept
the incorporation of their country as part of the
Frankish Empire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>In 808 the aged hero again took the field. He led
an expedition against Gottfried, King of Denmark,
who in years past had been so busy inciting Saxon
revolt. But the Emperor&rsquo;s purpose was not to obtain
satisfaction for old offences, but to stamp out
new hostilities. The Obotrites, allies of the Franks,
had been suddenly attacked by Gottfried; Danish
vessels had harried the German coast; and the Danes
had made several landings and pillaged and murdered.
Driven back by Carl, the Emperor&rsquo;s oldest
son, Gottfried reached a spot several miles beyond
the Schley, where a wall had been constructed across
the country, still known as the &ldquo;Danewerk.&rdquo; During
this expedition the Emperor was thrown from his
horse, which caused his lance to fly from his hand,
and his sword to drop from his belt. Many regarded
this as an unfortunate omen; but Gottfried
and Charlemagne did not meet on the field. Gottfried
was slain by some of his own people, and Hemming,
his brother and successor, hastened to send a
peace embassy to Charlemagne. A treaty was negotiated
by which Denmark renounced all claim upon
the territory for which it had striven, south of the
Eider, which was recognized as the northern boundary
of the Frankish Empire.</p>
<p>When Charlemagne returned to Aix-la-Chapelle
he was taken ill for the first time in his life. He regarded
his ailment, however, as nothing worse than
a slight feverish attack, and resumed his official
duties in a few days. For the first time his people
began to realize that he was mortal, and to ask themselves
what might happen to the Empire if he were
taken away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Of Charlemagne&rsquo;s three sons, the two eldest, Carl
and Pepin, had proved themselves heroes in the field.
Of these two, Carl, who most closely resembled his
father in face and figure, was his favorite. To his
great disappointment, however, he was forced to
admit to himself that Ludwig, the youngest, should
the emergency occur, would be unfitted to be his
successor, and unqualified to assure the perpetuity
of the Empire. And what was this great Empire?
It was bounded on the north by the Eider and the
Baltic, on the south by the Tiber and the Mediterranean,
on the east by the Elbe and the Raab, and
on the west by the Ebro and the Atlantic, recalling
the extent and power of the old Roman Empire under
C&aelig;sar and Augustus.</p>
<p>Charlemagne long and anxiously considered the
situation before he decided to call an assembly of
the dignitaries of State and Church and submit his
plans for the division of the sovereignty. These
plans provided for the assignment of the young Carl
to the principal part of the Frankish Empire, the
predominating German nations; Pepin to the Italian,
and Ludwig to those possessions which at a subsequent
period became the principal part of France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>The circle of those nearest the heart of the great
Emperor gradually grew smaller. His mother,
Bertha, had already been dead twenty years. This
rare woman, who in her will provided ample chests
of linen to poor weavers and spinners, enjoyed his
love and filial care to the very last. The Academy
still numbered many excellent scholars in its membership;
but there was no one to fill the place of that
wise teacher and close friend, Alcuin, who died about
this time. In 810 the Emperor&rsquo;s eldest daughter,
Rotrud, died. Hardly had he recovered from this
blow when news came of the death of Pepin, after a
brief illness.</p>
<p>Alas! of what avail are human plans? Too often
they are like the dust scattered by the wind. The
Emperor bore his grief manfully, and labored with
his customary devotion in his affairs of State and
at the academy. In these last days he began with
extraordinary enthusiasm to write a German grammar.
Unfortunately it was not finished, and the only
fragments left of it are the names which he gave to
the months and the winds.</p>
<p>The next year (811) was not finished before fresh
tidings of sorrow came. Carl, the Emperor&rsquo;s favorite
son, was snatched away by death in the very
prime of his life, as his brother Pepin had been
shortly before. Still the Emperor wasted no time in
mourning. He attended to his duties as usual; but
after this last blow his face never wore a smile again.</p>
<p>The only remaining son was the one who had
shown himself the least capable. What solicitude
for the future of his race and Empire must have
overwhelmed the Emperor!</p>
<div class="img" id="pic5">

<p class="caption"><i>OTTO THIRD in the crypt of Charlemagne</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>In the year 813 Charlemagne summoned the
notables of the Empire to an assembly at Aix-la-Chapelle.
He announced to them that he had
arranged a definite settlement of the boundary
question with Greece, Denmark, and the Moors,
which gave great satisfaction to them. Thereupon
he proclaimed his son Ludwig King of the Franks,
and added that he also wished, with their consent,
to invest him with the dignity of Roman Emperor.
They gave their consent, but there were grief in the
hearts and tears in the eyes of many of them.</p>
<p>Upon the day fixed for the coronation Charlemagne
appeared in the Cathedral imperially arrayed,
and met the notables assembled there. He led his
son Ludwig to the altar, where a throne had been
placed. After they had offered prayer they arose,
and Charlemagne made a solemn address to his son
in which he bade him always to be mindful of the
duties of a sovereign, closing with these words:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Compel malicious and dangerous disturbers by
force to live in an orderly manner and pursue the
right way. Be the consoler and defender of the
cloisters and the poor. Select only wise, just, and
firm counsellors. Never remove one except for
proper reasons, and so conduct yourself that you
may have no cause to blush before God or man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Ludwig had promised to follow these counsels
the Emperor ordered him to take the crown from
the altar and place it upon his head. This was
done. The Emperor was a loyal adherent of the
Church, but he did not care to have the ceremony
performed by priestly hands, as he feared that it
might open the way to future assumptions of a
dangerous kind. Supported by his son, the venerable
Emperor thereupon left for the palace.</p>
<p>Ludwig went temporarily to Aquitaine, which had
been assigned to him. The separation between
father and son was a painful one, for neither felt
that they should see each other again.</p>
<p>The people were greatly troubled, particularly by
a remarkable event which shortly occurred and so
worked upon the popular fancy that they expected
some dire calamity would follow. The colonnade
connecting the palace and the minster was struck
by lightning, the dome was injured, and the last
words upon the altar, &ldquo;Carolus princeps,&rdquo; were
effaced. But Charlemagne gave no attention to it.
It was of little consequence to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The year 814 opened. It was plain to all that
the Emperor was growing weaker. On the twenty-seventh
of January the last rites were administered
by Bishop Heldebald in both forms, and early the
next day Charlemagne passed away in the seventy-second
year of his age and the forty-seventh of his
reign, with the words &ldquo;Into Thy hands I commit
my spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The real nature of this calamity is shown by the
discussion which took place as to the suitable manner
of the Emperor&rsquo;s interment. He who had so long
watched over the welfare of the Empire, he who
had so often sat upon his steed as the battle hero,
upon his throne as lawgiver, judge, and counsellor,
and as teacher among the scholars of the academy,
should he now lie in a coffin? They could not
conceive of it. It was repugnant to the sentiment
of all those whose hearts were overcome by their
great loss. After earnest discussion they decided
upon a form of interment which should reflect
the greatness of that loss. Seated upon a marble
throne with gold adornments, in imperial garb
glistening with golden bees, the crown upon his
head, sword and pilgrim&rsquo;s scrip at his side, a Testament
upon his knees, and a fragment of the Holy
Cross at his breast, thus was the dead Emperor
lowered to the crypt of the minster, which was filled
with the costliest spices.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>One hundred and eighty-six years later, in the
year 1000, the German Emperor Otto the Third,
who was a victim of melancholy, opened the crypt,
hoping that the sight of the great dead would restore
peace and rest to his soul. The glare of torches
revealed the majestic figure of the Emperor, still
sitting upright on his throne. Otto, however, did
not find the rest for which he had hoped. Had he
realized the spirit of the Emperor, had he studied
him in his great works, perhaps it would have brought
him relief and the fresh incentive to activity might
have resulted in more faithful performance of his
duties as sovereign.</p>
<hr />
<p>A century and a half later the crypt was again
opened by Barbarossa, who ordered that the precious
remains of Charlemagne should be placed in a marble
casket and buried in the Cathedral.</p>
<hr />
<p>While reflecting with reverence upon this picture
of the Emperor in the crypt, we should also consider
the picture of the living Emperor, as revealed in
this story of his earthly pilgrimage. If we do this
in the right way, refusing to be influenced by those
harpies who pursue all great and noble men in history
that they may besmirch their memories, we shall be
inspired by the example of his great deeds to make our
own pilgrimage a blessing both to ourselves and others.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
